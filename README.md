## My First Project On PHP :) 

This is an investment apllication that deals on crypto investment, automated at some point and at some point manually manipulated.

There are two types of users, The first user is the ordinary user and the other user is the Admin.

User 1:
This user is the ordinary user who opens an account for investments and returns from the plateform, The user opens an account and provided with a dashboard that shows
him or her the overall activities happening in his accounts which includes the amount deposited and withdramn from the account and the amount which was invested and the
profits aquired from each investment done by that particular user.

How The User Investment Works
--For a user to invest he must fund the account from which the investment will be made from and the running investment will always be shown to the user in his dashbord.
together with the returns coming from the investment and the duration of the investment.

The investment works in such a way that the the returns are based on the amount of money invested which is also calculated with the current price of btc in the market at
that moment.
